# Debugging Summary

## Issues Found and Fixed

### 1. Port Configuration Mismatch
**Problem**: Electron main process was trying to load from `http://localhost:3000`, but webpack dev server was configured to run on port `3002`.

**Solution**: Updated `main.js` to use the correct port:
```javascript
const indexPath = this.isDev 
  ? 'http://localhost:3002'  // Changed from 3000 to 3002
  : `file://${path.join(__dirname, '../dist/index.html')}`;
```

### 2. API URL Mismatch
**Problem**: Auth handlers were pointing to wrong API URL (port 3000 instead of 3001).

**Solution**: Updated `main/auth-handlers.js`:
```javascript
const API_BASE_URL = 'http://localhost:3001/api'; // Changed from 3000 to 3001
```

### 3. SSH Server Key Format Issue
**Problem**: SSH server was using corrupted/incomplete OpenSSH key format that wasn't compatible with the ssh2 library.

**Solution**: 
- Replaced static key generation with proper RSA key generation using Node.js crypto module
- Used PKCS#1 format which is compatible with ssh2 library
- Added better error handling for SSH server startup

### 4. Duplicate Import Statements
**Problem**: `main.js` had duplicate import statements causing syntax errors.

**Solution**: Removed duplicate imports and fixed file structure.

### 5. Port Conflicts
**Problem**: Previous instances of the application were still running and blocking ports.

**Solution**: Added process cleanup commands and proper port management.

## Current Status

âœ… **Application Successfully Running**
- Webpack dev server: http://localhost:3002
- Backend API server: http://localhost:3001  
- SSH server: port 2222
- Swagger documentation: http://localhost:3001/api-docs
- Preview endpoint: http://localhost:3001/preview

## Remaining Non-Critical Issues

### 1. SASS Deprecation Warnings
- Using deprecated `@import` syntax instead of `@use`
- Using deprecated `darken()` function instead of `color.adjust()`
- These are warnings only and don't affect functionality

### 2. Webpack Dev Server Headers Warning
- "Can't set headers after they are sent" - internal webpack-dev-server issue
- Doesn't affect application functionality

### 3. Security Vulnerabilities
- 3 moderate severity vulnerabilities in prismjs/react-syntax-highlighter
- Can be fixed with `npm audit fix --force` but may introduce breaking changes

## Development Commands

```bash
# Start the full application (React + Electron + Backend)
npm start

# Start only the backend server
npm run backend:dev

# Start only the React development server
npm run react:dev

# Build for production
npm run build
```

## Architecture Overview

The application now runs with:
1. **Main Process (Electron)**: Window management, IPC, system monitoring
2. **Renderer Process (React)**: UI running on port 3002
3. **Backend Process (Express)**: API server on port 3001
4. **SSH Server**: Optional SSH access on port 2222

All processes communicate properly and the application should be fully functional for development and testing.
